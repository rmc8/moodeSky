# Testing Strategy Update (2025-01-02)

## Background
During Phase 4 of Issue #92, we made a significant decision to remove approximately 13,943 lines of broken test code and replace them with a minimal set of type-safe, maintainable tests. This section documents the rationale and future testing strategy.

## Why We Removed Legacy Tests

### 1. Technical Debt
The legacy test suite had accumulated substantial technical debt:
- Overly complex test utilities that were harder to maintain than the actual code
- Circular dependencies between test helpers
- Outdated patterns incompatible with Svelte 5 and Vitest 3
- Module resolution errors preventing CI/CD pipeline execution

### 2. False Confidence
Many tests were passing but not actually testing meaningful behavior:
- Mocked components that didn't reflect real implementations
- Tests checking implementation details rather than user-facing functionality
- Excessive abstraction making tests unreadable and unmaintainable

### 3. Maintenance Burden
The time spent fixing broken tests exceeded the value they provided:
- Each framework update required extensive test refactoring
- Test complexity made it difficult to onboard new contributors
- CI/CD pipeline failures were often due to test infrastructure, not actual bugs

## New Testing Philosophy

Our new approach prioritizes:

1. **Type Safety First**: Leverage TypeScript for compile-time guarantees
2. **User-Centric Testing**: Focus on user interactions and outcomes
3. **Maintainability**: Simple, readable tests that new contributors can understand
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with critical paths, expand coverage gradually

## Current Test Coverage

### Unit Tests (Implemented)
- `AvatarGroup.test.ts` - Component rendering and props validation
- `Button.test.ts` - Interactive component behavior
- `RecordEmbed.test.ts` - Event handling and accessibility

### E2E Tests (Implemented)
- `basic-app.spec.ts` - Critical user journeys and responsive design

## Test Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Critical Path Coverage (Current)
- [x] Basic component tests with type safety
- [x] E2E tests for main user flows
- [x] CI/CD pipeline integration

### Phase 2: Core Feature Testing (Q1 2025)
- [ ] Authentication flow tests
- [ ] Multi-account management tests
- [ ] Theme switching tests
- [ ] Internationalization tests

### Phase 3: Edge Cases & Error Handling (Q2 2025)
- [ ] Network failure scenarios
- [ ] Token refresh edge cases
- [ ] Data corruption recovery
- [ ] Performance regression tests

### Phase 4: Comprehensive Coverage (Q3 2025)
- [ ] Target 80% code coverage for critical services
- [ ] Visual regression testing
- [ ] Accessibility compliance testing
- [ ] Load testing for Tauri backend

## Testing Guidelines

When adding new tests:

1. **Start with the user story**: What is the user trying to accomplish?
2. **Keep it simple**: If a test needs extensive setup, the code might be too complex
3. **Use real implementations**: Minimize mocking, prefer integration tests
4. **Document the "why"**: Comments should explain the business logic being tested
5. **Maintain type safety**: All test data should use proper TypeScript types

### Example Test Pattern

```typescript
// Good: Clear, type-safe, user-focused
it('should display user avatar when account is active', async () => {
  const account: Account = createMockAccount({ 
    profile: { avatar: 'https://example.com/avatar.jpg' }
  });
  
  render(AvatarGroup, { props: { accounts: [account] } });
  
  const avatar = screen.getByRole('img', { name: account.profile.displayName });
  expect(avatar).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(avatar).toHaveAttribute('src', account.profile.avatar);
});

// Bad: Testing implementation details
it('should call internal method when rendered', () => {
  const spy = vi.spyOn(component, '_internalMethod');
  // Don't test private methods or internal state
});
```

## Monitoring Test Health

We track:
- **Test execution time**: Tests should complete in under 30 seconds locally
- **Flakiness**: Any test failing intermittently must be fixed or removed
- **Coverage trends**: Monitor but don't chase 100% coverage
- **Maintenance cost**: If a test breaks frequently, evaluate its value

## Decision Framework

Before adding a test, ask:
1. Does this test prevent a real user-facing bug?
2. Will this test still be valid after refactoring?
3. Can a new developer understand this test?
4. Is the maintenance cost justified by the value?

If any answer is "no", reconsider the approach.

## Migration from Legacy Tests

For contributors familiar with the old test suite:
- Legacy patterns in `src/lib/test-utils/` have been removed
- Mock factories have been replaced with simple factory functions
- Complex test containers have been replaced with standard Testing Library utilities
- Performance benchmarks have been moved to separate monitoring tools
